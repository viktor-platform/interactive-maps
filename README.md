# Interactive Maps
This template app displays data on a map, using Viktor and Python! As an engineer or data scientist, you may work with 
geo-located data. Visualizing this on a map is probably the best way to make this data insightful! This app visualizes 
points, lines, and polygons in a map and uses a flight analysis as an example. You can analyze a flight path and 
whether it passes through a no-fly zone.

This app contains:
- Selecting a start- and endpoint of a flight on an interactive map.
- Analyzing the flight path and visually checking if it passes through a no-fly zone.
