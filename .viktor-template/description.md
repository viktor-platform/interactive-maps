example. You can analyze a flight path and whether it passes through a no-fly zone with a visualization on an 
interactive map.

This app contains:
- Selecting a start- and endpoint of a flight on an interactive map.
- Analyzing the flight path and visually checking if it passes through a no-fly zone.A
